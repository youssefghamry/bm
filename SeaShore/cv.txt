PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE & SKILLS:
 Plan and Develop the Project Ideas
 Every project starts as an idea. It’s a project manager’s job to work with
internal stakeholders and external clients to define that concept and
create a process to bring it to fruition. This includes setting and
managing client expectations, developing a detailed project plan,
defining the scope of the project and assigning team members to
specific tasks
 span across a wide range of industries from engineering to financial
services. Every company wants to keep costs down without lowering
standards, and project managers help make this possible.
 Create and Lead Your Dream Team
 Project managers are accountable for every aspect of the project,
including leading a team capable of meeting or exceeding client
expectations for their vision. Successful project managers assemble and
manage these individuals to make a fine-tuned
project machine. If the team needs guidance, training or coaching,
it’s a project manager’s responsibility to set them up for success.
 In order to build and maintain a dynamic team mentality, a project
manager must be able to keep open and honest communication, form
working relationships and motivate anyone who needs it.
 Monitor Project Progress and Set Deadlines
 Organization and follow-through are a big part of a project manager’s job.
From creating an accurate timeline of project completion to ensuring
tasks are finished within the confines of the assignment, the project
manager must remain aware of how the project is progressing.
 The project manager also anticipates delays that may occur on the
client side and apprises the team of any changes in the client’s needs.
 Solve Issues That Arise
 During every project, issues arise that need to be solved. The project
manager is the first person who clients and team members turn to when
something goes wrong, so it is in these professionals’ best interest to
anticipate any potential hiccups before they happen. Adaptability and
problem solving are key to keeping control of a project.
 One issue that project managers need to have a plan for is change or
expansion in a project’s deliverables throughout a project, also known
as scope creep. This usually occurs when the scope of a project wasn’t
properly defined from the start, and it can seriously affect the timeline
and budget.
 Manage the budget
 Budget management is another primary project manager duty. These
professionals make sure that the project gets done without excessive
spending. A good project manager has mastered the art of cost
efficiency.
 Project managers also must be transparent and realistic about the cost
so clients are aware from the beginning how much they are likely to
spend.
 Ensure Stakeholder Satisfaction
 Project managers have the closest relationship with clients of anyone who
works on a project. Because of this, it is important that they keep open
lines of communication for updates and feedback. If any issues or
changes arise in the timeline of a project, for example, the project
manager is in charge of keeping the client up to date.
 Evaluate Project Performance
 After a project is finished, the project manager is responsible for
evaluating its efficiency and effectiveness. With the data they’ve
tracked throughout the process, they can begin to identify
shortcomings and plan for ways to fix similar issues in the future. This is
also an opportunity to highlight what went right, including building
camaraderie and rewarding team members who excelled during the
project.
 Project Management Skills:
 Because project manager responsibilities are abundant, a broad
range of skills is helpful in propelling them through the process,
including:
 Accountability
 Adaptability
 Budget Management
 Clear Communication
 Creativity
 Decisiveness
 Delegation
 Forecasting
